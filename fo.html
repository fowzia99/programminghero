            <p class="half-width "> <B> There is nothing quite like traveling, like seeing a new place for the first
                    time or
                    returning to a
                    favorite one. People of all ages, from all around the world, go to foreign places for different
                    reasons
                    – mainly,
                    for work, family, and leisure. Whether by plane, train, ship or by automobile, traveling is
                    generally a
                    pleasurable experience, at least for the people who can financially afford comfortable and safe
                    methods
                    of travel. But it has more benefits than satisfying one’s need to make money, like, for example, to
                    see
                    loved ones and enjoy oneself on vacation. There are other benefits of traveling worth mentioning and
                    trying out</B></P>
